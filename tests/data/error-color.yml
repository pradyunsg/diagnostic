# This file is distinct from render.yml since the corresponding test
# needs to have different behaviours:
#
# 1. Render the error object with a different function call.
# 2. Replace `\e` with ASCII ESC. This is to work around the following
#    limitation in YAML's literal scalars (i.e. the multiline string
#    with `|`):
#
#    > There is no way to escape characters inside literal scalars.
